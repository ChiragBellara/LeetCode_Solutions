# LeetCode Solutions


## Overview
This is the LeetCode Solutions repository! This repository contains my solutions to various LeetCode problems.

## Repository Structure
Each solution is organized into three folders
1.  Easy Questions
2.  Medium Questions
3.  Hard Questions
4.  General Algorithms

Each file will be named "Problem Number: Problem Name.py" and the files in the General Algorithms folder will be named with the algorithm they contain eg. BFS_and_DFS.py contains the code for basic BFS and DFS on a graph.

## Languages Used
The solutions are primarily written in Python. However, you may also find solutions in Java occasionally.
